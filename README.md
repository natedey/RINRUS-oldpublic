# RINRUS

Residue Interaction Network-based ResidUe Selector (RINRUS) is a QM-cluster model building tool.  Starting from a raw PDB file, after running a series of preparation tasks, the tool will
- select important residues for chemical reactions, and
- generate trimmed PDB files with the corresponding quantum chemical inputs.

## Installation

Clone this repository, then add the library code under `lib3` to your `PYTHONPATH`. For example, in `~/git`:
``` bash
cd ~/git
git clone git@github.com:MiloCheng17/RINRUS.git
export PYTHONPATH="~/git/RINRUS/lib3:$PYTHONPATH"
```

### Python dependencies

- Python >= 3.x
- NumPy
- pymol
  - If installing via conda, it's under `-c conda-forge pymol-open-source`.
- openbabel (required for Arpeggio)

For certain scripts (optional),
- matplotlib
- BioPython

### External dependencies

- [probe](https://github.com/rlabduke/probe) - version 2.16.130520 is packaged with RINRUS
- [reduce](https://github.com/rlabduke/reduce) - version 3.23 is packaged with RINRUS
- [arpeggio](http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/arpeggioweb)
- obabel version = openbabel/2.4.1

Currently, a precompiled copy of each is present in `bin/`.

which require
- CMake >= 3.10
- Any C/C++ compiler suite with C++11 support

PDB HET groups (some ligands and noncanonical amino acids) can be protonated by reduce. 
The connectivity table file is included with RINRIS: bin/reduce_wwPDB_het_dict.txt
You must set a shell environment variable to allow reduce to use the reduce_wwPDB_het_dict file, 
as the default location is /local:
setenv REDUCE_HET_DICT /home/$USER/git/RINRUS/bin/reduce_wwPDB_het_dict.txt 
or
export REDUCE_HET_DICT=/home/$USER/git/RINRUS/bin/reduce_wwPDB_het_dict.txt
Further preproccesing of ligands likely required!

Current production-level use cases are described in `bin/`.

## Usage example 1 - generating a single or a few input files with probe interaction count ranking 

## Usage example 2 - generating a single or a few input files with distance-based ranking

## Usage example 3 - generating a single or a few input files with arpeggio interaction-type ranking

## Usage example 4 - generating a single or a few input files with manual ranking (from SAPT, ML, or from some scheme that doesn't yet interface with RINRUS automatically)

## GENERATE ALL THE THINGS!!! Combinatorial model building from arpeggio or probe
## Usage example 5a - Combinatorial model building from arpeggio
## Usage example 5b - Combinatorial model building from probe
